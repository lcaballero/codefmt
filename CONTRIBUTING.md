Thank you so much for your interest in contributing to codefmt. We
are so happy that you are interested in our project, so we want to
offer some guidelines before you start.

## Questions

If you have questions, or if you want to share knowledge about

## Getting Started

### Filing a bug report or feature request

Before filing an issue, please check the existing
[issues](https://github.com/lcaballero/codefmt/issues) to see if a
similar one was already opened. If there is one already opened, feel
free to comment on it.

If you believe you've found a bug, please provide detailed steps of
reproduction, the version of codefmt, the imposters that are
involved and anything else you believe will be useful to help
troubleshoot it (e.g. OS environment, config file, flags,
etc...). Also, state the current behavior vs. the expected behavior.

If you'd like to see a feature or an enhancement please open an issue
with a clear title and description of what the feature is and why it
would be beneficial to the project and its users.

### Working on issues

codefmt releases work using
[milestones](https://github.com/lcaballero/codefmt/milestones), if
you see that some issue doesn't have any milestone it is possible that
the issue has not been reviewed yet by any maintainer or the issue
could be integrated in master without any impact, ie. a typo fix on
the README.

Each milestone has its own
[branch](https://github.com/lcaballero/codefmt/branches), so you
will need to wait until the issue has been assigned to a milestone
before you start your work, because you will need to base your changes
on that branch.

Before you start, please ask in the issue if you can take it and
request for a milestone if no milestone has been assigned yet.

Now, you are ready to contribute to make codefmt the best mock tool
in the world! [Fork
codefmt](https://github.com/lcaballero/codefmt/fork) and start!!
