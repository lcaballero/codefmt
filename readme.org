* Overview

This is a library based around convenience functions for formatting
and buffering string in the Go programming language.

There is _NO GO TEMPLATING_ used by this library.

Think =Sprintf= as the default.  And that the output is collected in a
buffer rather than sent to stdout.  Which means the =f= at the end of
=Sprintf= is redundant, and since all method calls are string oriented
the =S= is also redundant, because it not geared for low-level IO and
strings are good enough, in this case.

* Examples

The examples directory includes small programs that can be ran with:

#+begin_src shell :results output
go run ./examples/ex1/main.go
#+end_src

#+begin_example
